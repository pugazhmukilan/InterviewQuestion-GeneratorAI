      "In general, developing a mobile application is a complex and challenging task. There are \n",
      "many frameworks available  to develop a mobile application. Android provides a native \n",
      "framework based on Java language and iOS provides a native framework based on \n",
      "Objective-C / Shift language.  \n",
      "However, t o develop a n application supporting both the OSs, we need to c ode in two \n",
      "different languages using two different framework s. To help overcome this complexity, \n",
      "there exists mobile frameworks supporting both OS. These frameworks range from simple \n",
      "HTML based hybrid mobile application framework (which uses HTML for User Interface and \n",
      "JavaScript for application logic) to complex language specific framework (which do the \n",
      "heavy lifting of converting code to native code). Irrespective of their simplicity or \n",
      "complexity, these framework s always ha ve many disadvantages , one of t he main \n",
      "drawback being their slow performance. \n",
      "In this scenario, Flutter  – a simple and high performance framework based on Dart \n",
      "language, provides high performance by rendering the UI directly in the operating system’s \n",
      "canvas rather than through native framework.  \n",
      "Flutter also offers many ready to use widgets (UI) to create a modern application. These \n",
      "widgets are optimized for mobile environment and designing the application using widgets \n",
      "is as simple as designing HTML.  \n",
      "To be specific , Flutter application  is itself a widget. Flutter widgets also supports \n",
      "animations and gestures. The application logic is based on reactive programming. Widget \n",
      "may optionally have a state. By changing the state of the widget, Flutter will automatically \n",
      "(reactive programming) compare the widget’s state (old and new) and render the widget \n",
      "with only the necessary changes instead of re-rendering the whole widget.  \n",
      "We shall discuss the complete architecture in the coming chapters. \n",
      "Features of Flutter \n",
      "Flutter framework offers the following features to developers: \n",
      " Modern and reactive framework. \n",
      " Uses Dart programming language and it is very easy to learn. \n",
      " Fast development. \n",
      " Beautiful and fluid user interfaces. \n",
      " Huge widget catalog. \n",
      " Runs same UI for multiple platforms. \n",

      "Advantages of Flutter \n",
      "Flutter comes with beautiful  and customizable widgets for high performance and \n",
      "outstanding mobile application. It fulfills all the custom needs and requirements. Besides \n",
      "these, Flutter offers many more advantages as mentioned below: \n",
      " Dart has a large repository of software packages which lets you to extend the \n",
      "capabilities of your application. \n",
      " Developers need to write just a single code base for both applications (both Android \n",
      "and iOS platforms). Flutter may to be extended to other platform as well in the future. \n",
      " Flutter needs lesser testing. Because of its single code base, it is sufficient if we write \n",
      "automated tests once for both the platforms. \n",
      " Flutter’s simplicity makes it a good candidate for fast development. Its customization \n",
      "capability and extendibility makes it even more powerful. \n",
      " With Flutter, developers has full control over the widgets and its layout. \n",
      " Flutter offers great developer tools, with amazing hot reload. \n",
      "Disadvantages of Flutter \n",
      "Despite its many advantages, flutter has the following drawbacks in it: \n",
      " Since it is coded in Dart language, a developer needs to learn new language (though \n",
      "it is easy to learn). \n",
      " \n",
      " Modern framework tries to separate logic and UI as much as possible but, in Flutter, \n",
      "user interface and logic is intermixed. We can overcome this using smart coding and \n",
      "using high level module to separate user interface and logic. \n",
      " \n",
      " Flutter is yet another framework to create mobile application. Developers are having \n",

      "Widgets \n",
      "The core concept of the Flutter framework is In Flutter, Everything is a widget. Widgets \n",
      "are basically user interface components used to create the user interface of the application.  \n",
      "In Flutter, the application is itself a widget. The application is the top- level widget and its \n",
      "UI is build using one or more children (widgets), which again build  using its children \n",
      "widgets. This composability feature helps us to create a user interface of any complexity.  \n",
      "For example, the widget hierarchy of the hello world application (created in previous \n",

      "Here the following points are worth notable: \n",
      "4. Flutter – Architecture of Flutter ApplicationFlutter \n",
      "       \n",

      " \n",
      " MyApp is the user created widget and it is build using the Flutter native widget, \n",
      "MaterialApp.  \n",
      " \n",
      " MaterialApp has a home property to specify the user interface of the home page, \n",
      "which is again a user created widget, MyHomePage.  \n",
      " \n",
      " MyHomePage is build using another flutter native widget, Scaffold.  \n",
      " \n",
      " Scaffold has two properties – body and appBar.  \n",
      " \n",
      " body is used to specify its main user interface and appBar is used to specify its header \n",
      "user interface.  \n",

      " Header UI  is build using flutter native widget, AppBar and Body UI  is build using \n",

      " \n",
      " The Center widget has a property, Child, which refers the actual content and it is build \n",
      "using Text widget. \n",
      "Gestures \n",
      "Flutter widgets support interaction through a special widge t, GestureDetector. \n",
      "GestureDetector is an invisible widget having the ability to capture user interaction s such \n",
      "as tapping, dragging, etc., of its child widget. Many native widgets of Flutter support \n",
      "interaction through the use of GestureDetector. We can also incorporate interactive feature \n",
      "into the existing widget by composing it with the GestureDetector widget. We will learn \n",
      "the gestures separately in the upcoming chapters. \n",
      "Concept of State \n",
      "Flutter widgets support State maintenance by providing a special widget, StatefulWidget. \n",
      "Widget needs to be derived from StatefulWidget widget to support state maintenance and \n",
      "all other widget should be derived from StatelessWidget. Flutter widgets are reactive in \n",
      "native. This is similar to reactjs and StatefulWidget will be auto re- rendered whenever its \n",
      "internal state is changed. The re-rendering is optimized by finding the difference between \n",
      "old and new widget UI and rendering only the necessary changes. \n",
      "Layers \n",
      "The most important concept of Flutter framework is that t he framework is grouped into \n",
      "multiple category in terms of complexity and clearly arranged in layers of decreasing \n",
      "complexity. A layer is build using its immediate next level layer. The top most layer is \n",

      "multiple widgets into a single widget, Flutter provides large number of widgets with layout \n",
      "feature. For example, the child widget can be centered using Center widget.  \n",
      "Some of the popular layout widgets are as follows: \n",
      " Container: A rectangular box decorated using BoxDecoration widgets with \n",
      "background, border and shadow. \n",
      " \n",
      " Center: Center its child widget \n",
      " \n",
      " Row: Arrange its children in the horizontal direction. \n",
      " \n",
      " Column: Arrange its children in the vertical direction. \n",
      " \n",
      " Stack: Arrange one above the another. \n",

      "In Flutter, all widgets are either derived from StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget.  \n",
      "Widget derived from StatelessWidget does not have any state information but it may \n",
      "contain widget derived from StatefulWidget. The dynamic nature of the application is \n",
      "through interactive behavior of the widgets and the state change s during interaction. For \n",
      "example, tapping a counter button will increase / decrease the internal state of the counter \n",
      "by one and reactive nature of the Flutter widget will auto re-render the widget using new \n",

      "Animation enhances the user experience to a new level and provides a rich user \n",

      "simple and intuitive framework to develop all types of animations. \n",
      "Introduction \n",
      "Animation is a process of showing a series of images / picture in a particular order within \n",
      "a specific duration to g ive an illusion of movement. The most important aspects of the \n",
      "animation are as follows: \n",
      " Animation have two distinct values: Start value and End value. The animation starts \n",
      "from Start value and goes through a series of intermediate values and finally ends at \n",
      "End values. For example, to animate a widget to fade away, the initial value will be \n",
      "the full opacity and the final value will be the zero opacity. \n",
      " The intermediate values may be linear or non -linear (curve) in nature and it can be \n",
      "configured. Understand that t he animation works as it is configured. Each \n",
      "configuration provides a different feel to the animation. For example, fading a widget \n",
      "will be linear in nature whereas bouncing of a ball will be non-linear in nature. \n",
      " The duration of the animation process affects the speed (slowness or fastness) of the \n",
      "animation. \n",
      " The ability to control the animation process like starting the animation, stopping the \n",
      "animation, repeating the animation to set number of times, reversing the process of \n",
      "animation, etc., \n",
      " In Flutter, animation system does not do any real animation. Instead, it provides only \n",
      "the values required at every frame to render the images. \n",
      "Animation Based Classes \n",
      "Flutter animation system is based on Animation objects. The core animation classes and \n",
      "its usage are as follows: \n",
      "Animation  \n",
      "Generates interpolated values between two numbers over a certain duration. The most \n",
      "common Animation classes are: \n",
      " Animation<double> - interpolate values between two decimal number \n",
      " \n",
      " Animation<Color> - interpolate colors between two color \n",
      " \n",
      " Animation<Size> - interpolate sizes between two size \n",

      "10. Flutter – AnimationFlutter \n",
      "       \n",
      "83 \n",
      " \n",
      " AnimationController - Special Animation object to control the animation itself. It \n",
      "generates new values whenever the application is ready for a new frame. It \n",
      "supports linear based animation and the value starts from 0.0 to 1.0. \n",
      "controller = AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), \n",
      "vsync: this); \n",
      "Here, controller controls the animation and duration option controls the duration of \n",
      "the animation process. vsync is a special option used to optimize the resource used \n",
      "in the animation. \n",
      "CurvedAnimation \n",
      "Similar to AnimationController but supports non-linear animation. CurvedAnimation can \n",
      "be used along with Animation object as below: \n",
      "controller = AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), vsync: \n",
      "this); \n",
      "animation = CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn) \n",
      "Tween<T> \n",
      "Derived from Animatable<T> and used to generate numbers between any two numbers \n",
      "other than 0 and 1. It can be used along with Animation object by using animate method \n",
      "and passing actual Animation object. \n",
      "AnimationController controller = AnimationController( \n",
      "    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 1000), vsync: this); \n",
      "Animation<int> customTween = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(controller); \n",
      "Tween can also used along with CurvedAnimation as below: \n",
      "AnimationController controller = AnimationController(duration: const \n",
      "Duration(milliseconds: 500), vsync: this); \n",
      "final Animation curve = CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: \n",
      "Curves.easeOut); \n",
      "Animation<int> customTween = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(curve); \n",
      "Here, controller is the actual animation controller. curve provides the type of non-linearity \n",
      "and the customTween provides custom range from 0 to 255. \n",
      "Work flow of the Flutter Animation \n",
      "The work flow of the animation is as follows: \n",
      " Define and start the animation controller in the initState of the StatefulWidget. \n",
      "AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), vsync: this);             \n",

      "async/await pattern. For example, the below code reads the data from the specified \n",
      "url and print it in the console. \n",
      "print(await http.read('https://flutter.dev/')); \n",
      "Some of the core methods are as follows: \n",
      " read - Request the specified url through GET method and return back the response \n",

      " \n",
      " get - Request the specified url through GET meth od and return back the response \n",
      "as Future<Response>. Response is a class holding the response information. \n",
      " \n",
      " post - Request the specified url through POST method by posting the supplied data \n",
      "and return back the response as Future<Response> \n",
      " \n",
      " put - Request the specified url through PUT method and return back the response \n",
      "as Future<Response> \n",
      " \n",
      " head - Request the specified url through HEAD method and return back the \n",

      "Generally, three types of testing processes are available to completely test an application. \n",
      "They are as follows: \n",
      "Unit Testing \n",
      "Unit testing is the easiest method to test an application. It is based on ensuring the \n",
      "correctness of a piece of code (a function, in general)  o a method of a class. But, it does \n",
      "not reflect the real environment and subsequently, is the least option to find the bugs.  \n",
      "Widget Testing \n",
      "Widget testing is based on ensuring the correctness of the widget creation, rendering and \n",
      "interaction with other widgets as expected. It goes one step further and provides near \n",
      "real-time environment to find more bugs. \n",
      "Integration Testing \n",
      "Integration testing involves both unit testing and widget testing along with externa l \n",
      "component of the application like database, web service, etc., It simulate s or mocks the \n",

      "for Widget testing. In this chapter, we will discuss widget testing in detail.  \n",
      "Widget T esting \n",
      "Flutter testing framework provides testWidgets method to test widgets. It accepts two \n",
      "arguments: \n",
      " Test description \n",
      " Test code \n",

      " \n",
      "Steps Involved \n",
      "Widget Testing involves three distinct steps: \n",
      " Render the widget in the testing environment. \n",
      " WidgetTester is the class provided by Flutter testing framework to build and renders \n",
      "the widget. pumpWidget method of the WidgetTester class accepts any widget and \n",
      "renders it in the testing environment. \n",
      "testWidgets('finds a specific instance', (WidgetTester tester) async { \n",
      "    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp( \n",
      "        home: Scaffold( \n",
      "            body: Text('Hello'), \n",
      "        ), \n",
      "    )); \n",
      "}); \n",
      " Finding the widget, which we need to test. \n",
      " Flutter framework provides many options to find the widgets rendered in the testing \n",
      "environment and they are generally called Finders. The most frequently used \n",
      "finders are find.text, find.byKey and find.byWidget \n",
      " find.text finds the widget that contains the specified text. \n",
      "find.text('Hello') \n",
      " find.byKey find the widget by its specific key. \n",
      "find.byKey('home') \n",
      " find.byWidget find the widget by its instance variable \n",
      "find.byWidget(homeWidget) \n",
      " Ensuring the widget works as expected. \n",
      " Flutter framework provides many option s to match the widget with the expected \n",
      "widget and they are normally called Matchers. We can use the expect  method \n",
      "provided by the testing framework to match the widget, which we found in the second \n",
      "step with our our expected widget by choosing any of the matchers. Some of the \n",
      "important matchers are as follows: \n",
      " findsOneWidget - verifies a single widget is found. \n",
      "expect(find.text('Hello'), findsOneWidget); \n",
      " findsNothing - verifies no widgets are found. \n",
      "expect(find.text('Hello World'), findsNothing); \n",
      " findsWidgets - verifies more than a single widget is found.Flutter \n",
      "       \n",
      "149 \n",
      " \n",
      "expect(find.text('Save'), findsWidgets); \n",
      " findsNWidgets - verifies N number of widgets are found. \n",
      "expect(find.text('Save'), findsNWidgets(2)); \n",
      "The complete test code is as follows: \n",
      "testWidgets('finds hello widget', (WidgetTester tester) async { \n",
      "    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp( \n",
      "        home: Scaffold( \n",
      "            body: Text('Hello'), \n",
      "        ), \n",
      "    )); \n",
      " \n",
      "    expect(find.text('Hello'), findsOneWidget); \n",
      "}); \n",
      "Here, we rendered a MaterialApp widget with text Hello using Text widget in its body. \n",
      "Then, we used find.text to find the widget and then matched it using findsOneWidget.  \n",
      "Working Example \n",
      "Let us create a simple flutter application and write a widget test to understand better the \n",
      "steps involved and the concept. \n",
      " Create a new flutter application, flutter_test_app in Android studio. \n",
      " Open widget_test.dart in test folder. It has a sample testing code as given below: \n",
      "testWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async { \n",
      "    // Build our app and trigger a frame. \n",
      "    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp()); \n",
      " \n",
      "    // Verify that our counter starts at 0. \n",
      "    expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget); \n",
      "    expect(find.text('1'), findsNothing); \n",
      " \n",
      "    // Tap the '+' icon and trigger a frame. \n",

FLUTTER – CONCLUSION ................................ ................................ ...............................  1801 \\n \\nIn general, developing a mobile application is a complex and challenging task. There are \\nmany frameworks available  to develop a mobile application. Android provides a native \\nframework based on Java language and iOS provides a native framework based on \\nObjective-C / Shift language.  \\nHowever, t o develop a n application supporting both the OSs, we need to c ode in two \\ndifferent languages using two different framework s. To help overcome this complexity, \\nthere exists mobile frameworks supporting both OS. These frameworks range from simple \\nHTML based hybrid mobile application framework (which uses HTML for User Interface and \\nJavaScript for application logic) to complex language specific framework (which do the \\nheavy lifting of converting code to native code). Irrespective of their simplicity or \\ncomplexity, these framework s always ha ve many disadvantages , one of t he main \\ndrawback being their slow performance. \\nIn this scenario, Flutter  – a simple and high performance framework based on Dart \\nlanguage, provides high performance by rendering the UI directly in the operating system’s \\ncanvas rather than through native framework.  \\nFlutter also offers many ready to use widgets (UI) to create a modern application. These \\nwidgets are optimized for mobile environment and designing the application using widgets \\nis as simple as designing HTML.  \\nTo be specific , Flutter application  is itself a widget. Flutter widgets also supports \\nanimations and gestures. The application logic is based on reactive programming. Widget \\nmay optionally have a state. By changing the state of the widget, Flutter will automatically \\n(reactive programming) compare the widget’s state (old and new) and render the widget \\nwith only the necessary changes instead of re-rendering the whole widget.  \\nWe shall discuss the complete architecture in the coming chapters. \\nFeatures of Flutter \\nFlutter framework offers the following features to developers: \\n\\uf0b7 Modern and reactive framework. \\n\\uf0b7 Uses Dart programming language and it is very easy to learn. \\n\\uf0b7 Fast development. \\n\\uf0b7 Beautiful and fluid user interfaces. \\n\\uf0b7 Huge widget catalog. \\n\\uf0b7 Runs same UI for multiple platforms. \\n\\uf0b7 High performance application. \\n1. Flutter – IntroductionFlutter \\n       \\n2 \\n \\nAdvantages of Flutter \\nFlutter comes with beautiful  and customizable widgets for high performance and \\noutstanding mobile application. It fulfills all the custom needs and requirements. Besides \\nthese, Flutter offers many more advantages as mentioned below: \\n\\uf0b7 Dart has a large repository of software packages which lets you to extend the \\ncapabilities of your application. \\n\\uf0b7 Developers need to write just a single code base for both applications (both Android \\nand'),\n",

It fulfills all the custom needs and requirements. Besides \\nthese, Flutter offers many more advantages as mentioned below: \\n\\uf0b7 Dart has a large repository of software packages which lets you to extend the \\ncapabilities of your application. \\n\\uf0b7 Developers need to write just a single code base for both applications (both Android \\nand iOS platforms). Flutter may to be extended to other platform as well in the future. \\n\\uf0b7 Flutter needs lesser testing. Because of its single code base, it is sufficient if we write \\nautomated tests once for both the platforms. \\n\\uf0b7 Flutter’s simplicity makes it a good candidate for fast development. Its customization \\ncapability and extendibility makes it even more powerful. \\n\\uf0b7 With Flutter, developers has full control over the widgets and its layout. \\n\\uf0b7 Flutter offers great developer tools, with amazing hot reload. \\nDisadvantages of Flutter \\nDespite its many advantages, flutter has the following drawbacks in it: \\n\\uf0b7 Since it is coded in Dart language, a developer needs to learn new language (though \\nit is easy to learn). \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Modern framework tries to separate logic and UI as much as possible but, in Flutter, \\nuser interface and logic is intermixed. We can overcome this using smart coding and \\nusing high level module to separate user interface and logic. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Flutter is yet another framework to create mobile application. Developers are having \\na hard time in choosing the right development tools in hugely populated segment.Flutter \\n       \\n3 \\n \\n \\nThis chapter will guide you through the installation of Flutter  on your local computer in \\ndetail. \\nInstallation in Windows \\nIn this section, l et us see how to install Flutter SDK and its requireme nt in a windows \\nsystem. \\nStep 1: Go to URL, https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows and download the \\nlatest Flutter SDK .

AppBar is another widget to render the header of \\nthe application and we have used it in appBar property. In body property, we \\nhave used Center widget, which centers it child widget.

This composability feature helps us to create a user interface of any complexity.  \\nFor example, the widget hierarchy of the hello world application (created in previous \\nchapter) is as specified in the following diagram: \\nHere the following points are worth notable: \\n4. Flutter – Architecture of Flutter ApplicationFlutter \\n       \\n13 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 MyApp is the user created widget and it is build using the Flutter native widget, \\nMaterialApp.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 MaterialApp has a home property to specify the user interface of the home page, \\nwhich is again a user created widget, MyHomePage.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 MyHomePage is build using another flutter native widget, Scaffold.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Scaffold has two properties – body and appBar.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 body is used to specify its main user interface and appBar is used to specify its header \\nuser interface.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Header UI  is build using flutter native widget, AppBar and Body UI  is build using \\nCenter widget.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The Center widget has a property, Child, which refers the actual content and it is build \\nusing Text widget. \\nGestures \\nFlutter widgets support interaction through a special widge t, GestureDetector. \\nGestureDetector is an invisible widget having the ability to capture user interaction s such \\nas tapping, dragging, etc., of its child widget. Many native widgets of Flutter support \\ninteraction through the use of GestureDetector. We can also incorporate interactive feature \\ninto the existing widget by composing it with the GestureDetector widget. We will learn \\nthe gestures separately in the upcoming chapters. \\nConcept of State \\nFlutter widgets support State maintenance by providing a special widget, StatefulWidget. \\nWidget needs to be derived from StatefulWidget widget to support state maintenance and \\nall other widget should be derived from StatelessWidget. Flutter widgets are reactive in \\nnative. This is similar to reactjs and StatefulWidget will be auto re- rendered whenever its \\ninternal state is changed. The re-rendering is optimized by finding the difference between \\nold and new widget UI and rendering only the necessary changes. \\nLayers \\nThe most important concept of Flutter framework is that t he framework is grouped into \\nmultiple category in terms of complexity and clearly arranged in layers of decreasing \\ncomplexity. A layer is build using its immediate next level layer. The top most layer is \\nwidget specific to Android and iOS. The next layer has all flutter native widgets. The next \\nlayer is Rendering layer, which is low level renderer component and renders everything in \\nthe flutter app. Layers goes down to core platform specific code.Flutter \\n       \\n14 \\n \\nThe general overview of a layer in Flutter is specified in the below diagram: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe following points summarize the architecture of Flutter: \\n\\uf0b7 In Flutter, e verything is a widget and a complex widget is composed of already \\nexisting widgets. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Interactive features can be incorporated whenever ne cessary using GestureDetector \\nwidget. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The state of a widget can be maintained whenever necessary using StatefulWidget \\nwidget. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Flutter offers layered design so that any layer can be programmed depending on the \\ncomplexity of the task. \\n \\nWe will discuss all these concepts in detail in the upcoming chapters.Flutter \\n       \\n15 \\n \\nDart is an open-source general-purpose programming language. It is originally developed \\nby Google. Dart is an object -oriented language with C -style syntax.

It is originally developed \\nby Google. Dart is an object -oriented language with C -style syntax. It sup ports \\nprogramming concepts like interfaces, classes, unlike other programming languages Dart \\ndoesn’t support arrays. Dart collections can be used to replicate data structures such as \\narrays, generics, and optional typing. \\nThe following code shows a simple Dart program: \\nvoid main() \\n{ \\n    print(\"Dart language is easy to learn\"); \\n} \\nVariables and Data types \\nVariable is named storage location and Data types simply refers to the type and size of \\ndata associated with variables and functions. \\nDart uses var keyword to declare the variable. The syntax of var is defined below, \\nvar name = \\'Dart\\'; \\nThe final and const keyword are used to declare constants. They are defined as below: \\nvoid main() {  \\n   final a = 12;  \\n   const pi = 3.14;  \\n   print(a);  \\n   print(pi); \\n} \\nDart language supports the following data types: \\n\\uf0b7 Numbers: It is used to represent numeric literals – Integer and Double. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strings: It represents a sequence of characters. String values are specified in either \\nsingle or double quotes. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Booleans: Dart uses the bool keyword to represent Boolean values – true and false. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Lists and Maps: It is used to represent a collection of objects. A simple List can be \\ndefined as below: \\nvoid main() {  \\n   var list = [1,2,3,4,5];  \\n   print(list);  \\n} \\n5. Flutter – Introduction to Dart ProgrammingFlutter \\n       \\n16 \\n \\nThe list shown above produces [1,2,3,4,5] list. \\nMap can be defined as shown here: \\nvoid main() {  \\n   var mapping = {\\'id\\': 1,\\'name\\':\\'Dart\\'};  \\n   print(mapping);  \\n} \\n\\uf0b7 Dynamic: If the variable type is not defined, then its default type is dynamic. The \\nfollowing example illustrates the dynamic type variable: \\nvoid main() {  \\n   dynamic name = \"Dart\";  \\n   print(name);   \\n} \\nDecision Making and Loops \\nA decision making block evaluates a condition before the instructions are executed. Dart \\nsupports If, If..else and switch statements. \\nLoops are used to re peat a block of code until a specific condition is met. Dart supports \\nfor, for..in , while and do..while loops. \\nLet us understand a simple example about the usage of control statements and loops: \\nvoid main() {  \\n   for( var i = 1 ; i <= 10; i++ ) {  \\n      if(i%2==0) \\n      { \\n          print(i); \\n      } \\n   }  \\n} \\nThe above code prints the even numbers from 1 to 10. \\nFunctions \\nA function is a group of statements that together performs a specific task. Let us look into \\na simple function in Dart as shown here: \\nvoid main() {  \\n   add(3,4); \\n}   \\n \\nvoid add(int a,int b) {  \\n   int c; \\n   c=a+b; \\n   print(c); \\n}Flutter \\n       \\n17 \\n \\nThe above function adds two values and produces 7 as the output. \\nObject Oriented Programming \\nDart is an object-oriented language. It supports object-oriented programming features like \\nclasses, interfaces, etc.  \\nA class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class definition includes the following: \\n\\uf0b7 Fields \\n\\uf0b7 Getters and setters \\n\\uf0b7 Constructors \\n\\uf0b7 Functions \\nNow, let us create a simple class using the above definitions: \\nclass Employee {  \\n   String name;    \\n \\n   //getter method  \\n   String get emp_name {  \\n      return name;  \\n   }  \\n     \\n   //setter method \\n   void set emp_name(String name) {  \\n      this.name = name;  \\n   }  \\n    \\n   //function definition \\n   void result() \\n   { \\n       print(name); \\n   } \\n    \\n}   \\nvoid main() {  \\n   //object creation \\n   Employee emp = new Employee();  \\n   emp.name=\"employee1\"; \\n   emp.result();  //function call \\n}Flutter \\n       \\n18 \\n \\nAs we learned in the earlier chapter, widgets are everything in Flutter framework. We have \\nalready learned how to create new widgets in previous chapters.  \\nIn this chapter, let us understand the actual concept behind creating the widgets and the \\ndifferent type of widgets available in Flutter framework. \\nLet us check the Hello World application’s MyHomePage widget.

The code for this purpose \\nis as given below: \\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget { \\n  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key); \\n \\n  final String title; \\n \\n  @override \\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) { \\n    return Scaffold( \\n      appBar: AppBar( \\n        title: Text(this.title), \\n      ), \\n      body: Center( \\n          child: Text( \\n            \\'Hello World\\', \\n          )), \\n    ); \\n  } \\n} \\nHere, we have created a new widget by extending StatelessWidget.  \\nNote that the StatelessWidget only requires a single method build to be implemented in \\nits derived class. The build method gets the context environment necessary to build the \\nwidgets through BuildContext parameter and returns the widget it builds.  \\nIn the code, we have used title as one of the constructor argument and also used Key as \\nanother argument. The title is used to display the title and Key is used to identify the \\nwidget in the build environment.  \\nHere, the build method calls the build method of Scaffold, which in turn calls the build \\nmethod of AppBar and Center to build its user interface.  \\nFinally, Center build method calls Text build method. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6.

Android specific widgets are called as Material widgets.  \\niOS specific widgets are designed in accordance with Human Interface Guidelines by Apple \\nand they are called as Cupertino widgets. \\nSome of the most used material widgets are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Scaffold \\n\\uf0b7 AppBarFlutter \\n       \\n20 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 BottomNavigationBar \\n\\uf0b7 TabBar \\n\\uf0b7 TabBarView \\n\\uf0b7 ListTile \\n\\uf0b7 RaisedButton \\n\\uf0b7 FloatingActionButton \\n\\uf0b7 FlatButton \\n\\uf0b7 IconButton \\n\\uf0b7 DropdownButton \\n\\uf0b7 PopupMenuButton \\n\\uf0b7 ButtonBar \\n\\uf0b7 TextField \\n\\uf0b7 Checkbox \\n\\uf0b7 Radio \\n\\uf0b7 Switch \\n\\uf0b7 Slider \\n\\uf0b7 Date & Time Pickers \\n\\uf0b7 SimpleDialog \\n\\uf0b7 AlertDialog \\nSome of the most used Cupertino widgets are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoButton \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoPicker \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoDatePicker \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoTimerPicker \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoNavigationBar \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoTabBar \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoTabScaffold \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoTabView \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoTextField \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoDialog \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoDialogAction \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoFullscreenDialogTransition \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoPageScaffold \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoPageTransition \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoActionSheet \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoActivityIndicator \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoAlertDialog \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoPopupSurfaceFlutter \\n       \\n21 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 CupertinoSlider \\nLayout widgets \\nIn Flutter, a widget can be created by composing one or more widgets.

The dynamic nature of the application is \\nthrough interactive behavior of the widgets and the state change s during interaction. For \\nexample, tapping a counter button will increase / decrease the internal state of the counter \\nby one and reactive nature of the Flutter widget will auto re-render the widget using new \\nstate information. \\nWe will learn the  concept of StatefulWidget widgets in detail in the upcoming State \\nmanagement chapter. \\nPlatform independent / basic widgets \\nFlutter provides large number of basic widgets to create simple as well as complex user \\ninterface in a platform independent manner. Let us see some of the basic widgets in this \\nchapter. \\nText \\nText widget is used to display a piece of string. The style of the string can be set by using \\nstyle property and TextStyle class. The sample code for this purpose is as follows: \\nText(\\'Hello World!\\', style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)) \\nText widget has a special constructor, Text.rich, which accepts the child of type TextSpan \\nto specify the string with different style. TextSpan widget is recursive in nature and it \\naccepts TextSpan as its children. The sample code for this purpose is as follows:Flutter \\n       \\n22 \\n \\nText.rich( \\n    TextSpan( \\n      children: <TextSpan>[ \\n        TextSpan(text: \"Hello \", style: TextStyle(fontStyle: \\nFontStyle.italic)), \\n        TextSpan(text: \"World\", style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)), \\n      ], \\n    ), \\n) \\nThe most important properties of the Text widget are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 maxLines, int: Maximum number of lines to show \\n \\n\\uf0b7 overflow, TextOverFlow: Specify how visual overflow is handled using \\nTextOverFlow class \\n \\n\\uf0b7 style, TextStyle: Specify the style of the string using TextStyle class \\n \\n\\uf0b7 textAlign, TextAlign: Alignment of the text like right, left, justify, etc., using \\nTextAlign class \\n \\n\\uf0b7 textDirection, TextDirection: Direction of text to flow, either left -to-right or right-\\nto-left \\nImage \\nImage widget is used to display an image in the application. Image widget provides \\ndifferent constructors to load images from multiple sources and they are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Image - Generic image loader using ImageProvider \\n\\uf0b7 Image.asset - Load image from flutter project’s assets \\n\\uf0b7 Image.file - Load image from system folder \\n\\uf0b7 Image.memory - Load image from memory \\n\\uf0b7 Image.Network - Load image from network \\nThe easiest option to load and display an image in Flutter is by including the image as \\nassets of the application and load it into the widget on demand. \\n\\uf0b7 Create a folder, assets in the project folder and place the necessary images. \\n\\uf0b7 Specify the assets in the pubspec.yaml as shown below: \\nflutter: \\n  assets: \\n    - assets/smiley.png \\n\\uf0b7 Now, load and display the image in the application. \\nImage.asset(\\'assets/smiley.png\\')Flutter \\n       \\n23 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The complete source code of MyHomePage widget of the hello world application and \\nthe result is as shown below: \\nclass MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget { \\n  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key); \\n \\n  final String title; \\n \\n  @override \\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) { \\n    return Scaffold( \\n      appBar: AppBar( \\n        title: Text(this.title), \\n      ), \\n      body: Center( \\n          child: Image.asset(\"assets/smiley.png\") \\n      ), \\n    ); \\n  } \\nThe loaded image is as shown below:Flutter \\n       \\n24 \\n \\nThe most important properties of the Image widget are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 image,'),\n",

Flutter provides quite a lot of specially \\ndesigned widgets like Container, Center, Align, etc., only for the purpose of laying out the \\nuser interface. Widgets build by composing other widgets normally use layout widgets. Let \\nuse learn the Flutter layout concept in this chapter. \\nT ype of Layout Widgets \\nLayout widgets can be grouped into two distinct category based on its child: \\n\\uf0b7 Widget supporting a single child \\n\\uf0b7 Widget supporting multiple child \\nLet us learn both type of widgets and its functionality in the upcoming sections. \\nSingle Child Widgets \\nIn this category, widgets will have only one widget as its child  and every widget will have \\na special layout functionality.  \\nFor example, Center widget just centers it child widget with respect to its parent widget \\nand Container widget provides complete flexibility to place it child at any given place inside \\nit using different option like padding, decoration, etc.,  \\nSingle child widgets are great option s to create high quality widget hav ing single \\nfunctionality such as button, label, etc.,  \\nThe code to create a simple button using Container widget is as follows: \\nclass MyButton extends StatelessWidget { \\n  MyButton({Key key}) : super(key: key); \\n \\n  @override \\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) { \\n    return Container( \\n      decoration: const BoxDecoration( \\n        border: Border( \\n          top: BorderSide(width: 1.0, color: Color(0xFFFFFFFFFF)), \\n          left: BorderSide(width: 1.0, color: Color(0xFFFFFFFFFF)), \\n          right: BorderSide(width: 1.0, color: Color(0xFFFF000000)), \\n          bottom: BorderSide(width: 1.0, color: Color(0xFFFF000000)), \\n        ), \\n      ), \\n      child: Container( \\n        padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20.0, vertical: 2.0), \\n        decoration: const BoxDecoration( \\n          border: Border( \\n            top: BorderSide(width: 1.0, color: Color(0xFFFFDFDFDF)), \\n7.

Here, padding can \\nbe provided by EdgeInsets class. \\n\\uf0b7 Align: Align its child widget within itself using the value of alignment property. The \\nvalue for alignment property can be provided by FractionalOffset class. The \\nFractionalOffset class specifies the offsets in terms of a distance from the top left.  \\nSome of the possible values of offsets are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 FractionalOffset(1.0, 0.0) represents the top right. \\n\\uf0b7 FractionalOffset(0.0, 1.0) represents the bottom left. \\n\\uf0b7 A sample code about offsets is shown below: \\nCenter( \\n  child: Container( \\n    height: 100.0, \\n    width: 100.0, \\n    color: Colors.yellow, \\n    child: Align( \\n      alignment: FractionalOffset(0.2, 0.6), \\n      child: Container( \\n        height: 40.0, \\n        width: 40.0, \\n        color: Colors.red, \\n      ), \\n    ), \\n  ), \\n) \\n\\uf0b7 FittedBox: It scales the child widget and then positions it according to the specified \\nfit. \\n\\uf0b7 AspectRatio: It attempts to size the child widget to the specified aspect ratioFlutter \\n       \\n28 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 ConstrainedBox \\n\\uf0b7 Baseline \\n\\uf0b7 FractinallySizedBox \\n\\uf0b7 IntrinsicHeight \\n\\uf0b7 IntrinsicWidth \\n\\uf0b7 LiimitedBox \\n\\uf0b7 OffStage \\n\\uf0b7 OverflowBox \\n\\uf0b7 SizedBox \\n\\uf0b7 SizedOverflowBox \\n\\uf0b7 Transform \\n\\uf0b7 CustomSingleChildLayout \\nOur hello world application is using material based layout widgets to design the home \\npage.

The state change will be done \\nthrough gestures. For example, the rating of a product  can be changed by tapping a star \\nin the rating widget. \\nLet us create a widget, RatingBox with state maintenance. The purpose of the widget is to \\nshow the current rating of a specific product. The step by step process for creating a \\nRatingBox widget with state maintenance is as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Create the widget, RatingBox by inheriting StatefulWidget \\nclass RatingBox extends StatefulWidget { \\n} \\n\\uf0b7 Create a state for RatingBox, _RatingBoxState by inheriting State<T> \\nclass _RatingBoxState extends State<RatingBox> { \\n} \\n9. Flutter – State ManagementFlutter \\n       \\n46 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Override the createState of StatefulWidget method to create the state, \\n_RatingBoxState \\nclass RatingBox extends StatefulWidget { \\n  @override \\n  _RatingBoxState createState() => _RatingBoxState(); \\n} \\nCreate the user interface of the RatingBox widget in build method of _RatingBoxState. \\nUsually, the user interface will be done in the build method of RatingBox widget itself. But, \\nwhen state maintenance is needed, we need to build the user interface in _RatingBoxState \\nwidget. This ensures the re -rendering of user interface whenever the state of the widget \\nis changed. \\nWidget build(BuildContext context) { \\n  double _size = 20; \\n  print(_rating); \\n \\n  return Row( \\n    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end, \\n    crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end, \\n    mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.max, \\n    children: <Widget>[ \\n      Container( \\n        padding: EdgeInsets.all(0), \\n        child: IconButton( \\n          icon: (_rating >= 1 ? Icon(Icons.star, size: _size,) : \\nIcon(Icons.star_border, size: _size,)), \\n          color: Colors.red[500], \\n          iconSize: _size, \\n        ), \\n      ), \\n      Container( \\n        padding: EdgeInsets.all(0), \\n        child: IconButton( \\n          icon: (_rating >= 2 ?

The idea is to show the rating through the sequence of red  stars. \\nFor example, if the rating is two star, then first two star will be red and the last one is in \\nwhite. \\n\\uf0b7 Write methods in _RatingBoxState to change / set the state of the widget. \\nvoid _setRatingAsOne() { \\n  setState( () { \\n    _rating = 1; \\n  }); \\n} \\n \\nvoid _setRatingAsTwo() { \\n \\n  setState( () { \\n    _rating = 2; \\n  }); \\n} \\n \\nvoid _setRatingAsThree() { \\n  setState( () { \\n    _rating = 3; \\n  }); \\n} \\n\\uf0b7 Here, each method sets the current rating of the widget through setState \\n\\uf0b7 Wire the user gesture (tapping the star) to the proper state changing method. \\nWidget build(BuildContext context) { \\n  double _size = 20; \\n  print(_rating); \\n \\n  return Row( \\n    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end, \\n    crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end, \\n    mainAxisSize:'),\n",

For example, if a user clicks the third star, then \\n_setRatingAsThree will be called and it will change the _rating to 3. Since the state is \\nchanged, the build method will be called again and the user interface will be build and \\nrendered again. \\n\\uf0b7 The complete code of the widget, RatingBox is as follows: \\nclass RatingBox extends StatefulWidget { \\n  @override \\n  _RatingBoxState createState() => _RatingBoxState(); \\n} \\n \\nclass _RatingBoxState extends State<RatingBox> { \\n  int _rating = 0; \\n \\n  void _setRatingAsOne() { \\n    setState( () { \\n      _rating = 1; \\n    }); \\n  } \\n \\n  void _setRatingAsTwo() { \\n \\n    setState( () { \\n      _rating = 2; \\n    }); \\n  } \\n \\n  void _setRatingAsThree() { \\n    setState( () { \\n      _rating = 3; \\n    }); \\n  } \\n \\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {Flutter \\n       \\n49 \\n \\n    double _size = 20; \\n    print(_rating); \\n \\n    return Row( \\n      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end, \\n      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.end, \\n      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.max, \\n      children: <Widget>[ \\n        Container( \\n          padding: EdgeInsets.all(0), \\n          child: IconButton( \\n            icon: (_rating >= 1 ?

The way that the navigation of an application is handled is called Routing. \\nFlutter provides a basic routing class  – MaterialPageRoute and two m ethods - \\nNavigator.push  and Navigator.pop, to define the work flow of an application. \\nMaterialPageRoute \\nMaterialPageRoute is a widget used to render its UI by replacing the entire screen with a \\nplatform specific animation. \\nMaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => Widget()) \\nHere, builder will accepts a function to build its content by suppling the current context of \\nthe application. \\nNavigation.pushFlutter \\n       \\n69 \\n \\nNavigation.push is used to navigate to new screen using MaterialPageRoute widget. \\nNavigator.push( \\n    context, \\n    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => Widget()), \\n); \\nNavigation.pop \\nNavigation.pop is used to navigate to previous screen. \\nNavigator.push(context); \\nLet us create a new application to better understand the navigation concept. \\nCreate a new Flutter application in Android studio, product_nav_app \\n\\uf0b7 Copy the assets folder from product_nav_app to product_state_app and add assets \\ninside the pubspec.yaml file \\nflutter: \\n \\n  assets: \\n    - assets/appimages/floppy.png \\n    - assets/appimages/iphone.png \\n    - assets/appimages/laptop.png \\n    - assets/appimages/pendrive.png \\n    - assets/appimages/pixel.png \\n    - assets/appimages/tablet.png \\n\\uf0b7 Replace the default startup code (main.dart) with our startup code. \\nimport \\'package:flutter/material.dart\\'; \\n \\nvoid main() => runApp(MyApp()); \\n \\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget { \\n  // This widget is the root of your application. \\n  @override'),\n",

In spite of its complexity, \\nAnimation enhances the user experience to a new level and provides a rich user \\ninteraction. Due to its richness, animation becomes an integral part of modern mobile \\napplication. Flutter framework recognizes the importance of Animation and provides a  \\nsimple and intuitive framework to develop all types of animations. \\nIntroduction \\nAnimation is a process of showing a series of images / picture in a particular order within \\na specific duration to g ive an illusion of movement. The most important aspects of the \\nanimation are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 Animation have two distinct values: Start value and End value. The animation starts \\nfrom Start value and goes through a series of intermediate values and finally ends at \\nEnd values. For example, to animate a widget to fade away, the initial value will be \\nthe full opacity and the final value will be the zero opacity. \\n\\uf0b7 The intermediate values may be linear or non -linear (curve) in nature and it can be \\nconfigured. Understand that t he animation works as it is configured. Each \\nconfiguration provides a different feel to the animation. For example, fading a widget \\nwill be linear in nature whereas bouncing of a ball will be non-linear in nature. \\n\\uf0b7 The duration of the animation process affects the speed (slowness or fastness) of the \\nanimation. \\n\\uf0b7 The ability to control the animation process like starting the animation, stopping the \\nanimation, repeating the animation to set number of times, reversing the process of \\nanimation, etc., \\n\\uf0b7 In Flutter, animation system does not do any real animation. Instead, it provides only \\nthe values required at every frame to render the images. \\nAnimation Based Classes \\nFlutter animation system is based on Animation objects. The core animation classes and \\nits usage are as follows: \\nAnimation  \\nGenerates interpolated values between two numbers over a certain duration. The most \\ncommon Animation classes are: \\n\\uf0b7 Animation<double> - interpolate values between two decimal number \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Animation<Color> - interpolate colors between two color \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Animation<Size> - interpolate sizes between two size \\n \\n10. Flutter – AnimationFlutter \\n       \\n83 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 AnimationController - Special Animation object to control the animation itself. It \\ngenerates new values whenever the application is ready for a new frame. It \\nsupports linear based animation and the value starts from 0.0 to 1.0. \\ncontroller = AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), \\nvsync: this); \\nHere, controller controls the animation and duration option controls the duration of \\nthe animation process. vsync is a special option used to optimize the resource used \\nin the animation. \\nCurvedAnimation \\nSimilar to AnimationController but supports non-linear animation. CurvedAnimation can \\nbe used along with Animation object as below: \\ncontroller = AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), vsync: \\nthis); \\nanimation = CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn) \\nTween<T> \\nDerived from Animatable<T> and used to generate numbers between any two numbers \\nother than 0 and 1. It can be used along with Animation object by using animate method \\nand passing actual Animation object. \\nAnimationController controller = AnimationController( \\n    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 1000), vsync: this); \\nAnimation<int> customTween = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(controller'),\n",

Dart \\nPackage is simply sharable libraries or modules. In general, the Dart Package is same as \\nthat of Dart Application except Dart Package does not have application entry point, main.  \\nThe general structure of Package (consider a demo package, my_demo_package) is as \\nbelow: \\n\\uf0b7 lib/src/* : Private Dart code files. \\n\\uf0b7 lib/my_demo_package.dart: Main Dart code file. It can be imported into an \\napplication as: \\nimport \\'package:my_demo_package/my_demo_package.dart\\' \\n\\uf0b7 Other private code file may be exported into the main code file \\n(my_demo_package.dart), if necessary as shown below: \\nexport src/my_private_code.dart \\n\\uf0b7 lib/* : Any number of Dart code files arranged in any custom folder structure. The \\ncode can be accessed as, \\nimport \\'package:my_demo_package/custom_folder/custom_file.dart\\' \\n\\uf0b7 pubspec.yaml:  Project specification, same as that of application. \\nAll Dart code files in the Package are simply Dart classes and it does not have any special \\nrequirement for a Dart code to include it in a Package. \\nT ypes of Packages \\nSince Dart Packages  are basically a small collection of similar functionality, it can be \\ncategorized based on its functionality. \\nDart Package \\nGeneric Dart code, which can be used in both web and mobile environment. For example, \\nenglish_words is one such package which contains around 5000 words and has basic utility \\nfunctions like nouns (list nouns in the English), syllables (specify number of syllables in a \\nword. \\nFlutter Package \\nGeneric Dart code, which depends on Flutter framework and can be used only in mobile \\nenvironment. For example, fluro is a custom router for flutter. It depends on the Flutter \\nframework. \\n \\n13. Flutter – Introduction to PackageFlutter \\n       \\n104 \\n \\nFlutter Plugin \\nGeneric Dart code, which depends on Flutter framework as well as the underlying platform \\ncode (Android SDK or iOS SDK). For example, camera is a plugin to interact with device \\ncamera. It depends on the Flutter framework as well as the underlying framework to get \\naccess to camera. \\nUsing a Dart Package \\nDart Packages  are hosted and published into the live server, https://pub.dartlang.org. \\nAlso, Flutter provides simple tool , pub to manage Dart Packages in the application.

It provides many high level methods and simplifies the \\ndevelopment of REST based mobile applications. \\nBasic Concepts \\nhttp package provides a high level class and http to do web requests.  \\n\\uf0b7 http class provides functionality to perform all types of HTTP requests.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 http methods accept a url, and additional information through Dart Map (post data, \\nadditional headers, etc.,). It requests the server and collects the response back in \\nasync/await pattern. For example, the below code reads the data from the specified \\nurl and print it in the console. \\nprint(await http.read(\\'https://flutter.dev/\\')); \\nSome of the core methods are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 read - Request the specified url through GET method and return back the response \\nas Future<String> \\n \\n\\uf0b7 get - Request the specified url through GET meth od and return back the response \\nas Future<Response>. Response is a class holding the response information. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 post - Request the specified url through POST method by posting the supplied data \\nand return back the response as Future<Response> \\n \\n\\uf0b7 put - Request the specified url through PUT method and return back the response \\nas Future<Response> \\n \\n\\uf0b7 head - Request the specified url through HEAD method and return back the \\nresponse as Future<Response> \\n \\n\\uf0b7 delete - Request the specified url through DELETE method and return back the \\nresponse as Future<Response> \\nhttp also provides a more standard HTTP client class, client. client supports persistent \\nconnection. It will be useful when a lot of request to be made to a particular server. It \\nneeds to be closed properly using close method. Otherwise, it is similar to http class. The \\nsample code is as follows: \\nvar client = new http.Client(); \\ntry { \\n  print(await client.get(\\'https://flutter.dev/\\')); \\n} finally { \\n  client.close(); \\n} \\n14.

It is based on ensuring the \\ncorrectness of a piece of code (a function, in general)  o a method of a class. But, it does \\nnot reflect the real environment and subsequently, is the least option to find the bugs.  \\nWidget Testing \\nWidget testing is based on ensuring the correctness of the widget creation, rendering and \\ninteraction with other widgets as expected. It goes one step further and provides near \\nreal-time environment to find more bugs. \\nIntegration Testing \\nIntegration testing involves both unit testing and widget testing along with externa l \\ncomponent of the application like database, web service, etc., It simulate s or mocks the \\nreal environment to find nearly all bugs, but it is the most complicated process. \\nFlutter provides support for all types of testing. It provides extensive and exclusive support \\nfor Widget testing. In this chapter, we will discuss widget testing in detail.  \\nWidget T esting \\nFlutter testing framework provides testWidgets method to test widgets. It accepts two \\narguments: \\n\\uf0b7 Test description \\n\\uf0b7 Test code \\ntestWidgets(\\'test description: find a widget\\', \\'<test code>\\'); \\n \\n \\n \\n17. Flutter – TestingFlutter \\n       \\n148 \\n \\nSteps Involved \\nWidget Testing involves three distinct steps: \\n\\uf0b7 Render the widget in the testing environment. \\n\\uf0b7 WidgetTester is the class provided by Flutter testing framework to build and renders \\nthe widget. pumpWidget method of the WidgetTester class accepts any widget and \\nrenders it in the testing environment. \\ntestWidgets(\\'finds a specific instance\\', (WidgetTester tester) async { \\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp( \\n        home: Scaffold( \\n            body: Text(\\'Hello\\'), \\n        ), \\n    )); \\n}); \\n\\uf0b7 Finding the widget, which we need to test. \\n\\uf0b7 Flutter framework provides many options to find the widgets rendered in the testing \\nenvironment and they are generally called Finders. The most frequently used \\nfinders are find.text, find.byKey and find.byWidget \\n\\uf0b7 find.text finds the widget that contains the specified text. \\nfind.text(\\'Hello\\') \\n\\uf0b7 find.byKey find the widget by its specific key. \\nfind.byKey(\\'home\\') \\n\\uf0b7 find.byWidget find the widget by its instance variable \\nfind.byWidget(homeWidget) \\n\\uf0b7 Ensuring the widget works as expected. \\n\\uf0b7 Flutter framework provides many option s to match the widget with the expected \\nwidget and they are normally called Matchers. We can use the expect  method \\nprovided by the testing framework to match the widget, which we found in the second \\nstep with our our expected widget by choosing any of the matchers. Some of the \\nimportant matchers are as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 findsOneWidget - verifies a single widget is found. \\nexpect(find.text(\\'Hello\\'), findsOneWidget); \\n\\uf0b7 findsNothing - verifies no widgets are found. \\nexpect(find.text(\\'Hello World\\'), findsNothing); \\n\\uf0b7 findsWidgets - verifies more than a single widget is found.Flutter \\n       \\n149 \\n \\nexpect(find.text(\\'Save\\'), findsWidgets); \\n\\uf0b7 findsNWidgets - verifies N number of widgets are found. \\nexpect(find.text(\\'Save\\'), findsNWidgets(2)); \\nThe complete test code is as follows: \\ntestWidgets(\\'finds hello widget\\', (WidgetTester tester) async { \\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp( \\n        home:'),\n",

It has a sample testing code as given below: \\ntestWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async { \\n    // Build our app and trigger a frame. \\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp()); \\n \\n    // Verify that our counter starts at 0. \\n    expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget); \\n    expect(find.text('1'), findsNothing); \\n \\n    // Tap the '+' icon and trigger a frame. \\n    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.add)); \\n    await tester.pump(); \\n \\n    // Verify that our counter has incremented. \\n    expect(find.text('0'), findsNothing); \\n    expect(find.text('1'), findsOneWidget);  \\n  }); \\n\\uf0b7 Here, the test code does the following functionalities: \\n\\uf0b7 Renders MyApp widget using tester.pumpWidget \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Ensures that the counter is initially zero using findsOneWidget and findsNothing \\nmatchers.Flutter \\n       \\n150 \\n \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Finds the counter increment button using find.byIcon method. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Taps the counter increment button using tester.tap method. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Ensures that the counter is increased using findsOneWidget and findsNothing \\nmatchers. \\n\\uf0b7 Let us again tap the counter increment button and then check whether the counter \\nis increased to two. \\nawait tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.add)); \\nawait tester.pump(); \\n \\nexpect(find.text('2'), findsOneWidget);  \\n\\uf0b7 Click Run menu. \\n\\uf0b7 Click tests in widget_test.dart option. This will run the test and report the result in \\nthe result window.Flutter \\n       \\n151 \\n \\nThis chapter explains how to deploy Flutter application in both Android and iOS platforms. \\nAndroid Application \\n\\uf0b7 Change the application name using android:label entry in android manifest file. \\nAndroid app manifest file, AndroidManifest.xml is located  in <app \\ndir>/android/app/src/main.
